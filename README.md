This is a smart parking system using RFID Tags is an innovative solution aimed at 
automating and streamlining the process of parking management, which is especially useful in 
urban areas with high traffic and limited parking space. This system uses Radio Frequency 
Identification (RFID) technology to identify and authenticate vehicles, making the parking 
process faster, more secure, and more efficient.

The system works by equipping vehicles with RFID tags that store information about the 
vehicle and, potentially, the owner. When a vehicle approaches a parking facility, an RFID 
reader scans the tag, allowing for automated entry if the vehicle is authorized or if a parking 
space is available. This eliminates the need for manual ticketing, reduces the likelihood of 
unauthorized parking, and can even integrate with mobile applications for real-time updates on 
parking availability.
